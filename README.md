# Play-Ball
Website designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Mysql. It is a Cricket Management System.
This can be used for personal use and for small cricket camps to maintain records and the data of each and every single game. It can also be used at the corparate level cricket to maintain data but the task involved in filling the data is little time consuming we are working on it and we may bring a better interface for maintaing records easier. We have added all the files including the database which we created and used for this web application, the database name is 'dbms' which is included in the cricket folder.

International cricket matches implement highly sophisticated database management systems to record, analyse and manage the statistical data related to batting, bowling and fielding. But such database management is rarely used at the lower levels of cricket like Corporate Level, Cricket Camps and Inter-School tournaments due to the cost and complexity involved in maintaining such a system.

So we have implemented a similar, user-friendly and lighter version of such systems with barebone features that the target users will require. Using our management system called PLAY BALLTM, you can create new matches, update scores, register new players, access scorecards, get live feed of matches, see player profiles etc. We plan to add more features as time goes.
